WalmartLab Sample Project
=========================

About
-----

I started this project after I noticed WalmartLab open API. You will find both WalmartLab open API 
service and test API service.

Currently, the app is configured to run test API mode. This mode can be easily changed to open API
mode by updating the main storyboard name in the app's "General" setting.

I improved the original open API sample project code to support test api service with the following requirements:

- Provide product list.
- Provide product details.
- Pagination, loading pages of products incrementally.
- Image caching/loading.
- No 3rd party library use.
- Support both iPhone/iPad.
- Swipe left to right to go previous and next.

To Run
------

Open WalmartLab.xcworkspace to open the project. And, run with Xcode "Build and run."
